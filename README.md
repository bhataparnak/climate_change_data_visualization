Software used: R and R studio
packages used: ggplot2,GGally,dplyr

The data set provided deals with world temperatures and comes from NASA. Alternatively you can use any data that you would like to explore.

Take the data from the GISTEMP site, specifically the data from “Table Data: Global and Hemispheric Monthly Means and Zonal Annual Means.” Alternatively you can use any data that you would like to explore instead.

Parse the data to a suitable format for the tools that you are using – we have provided two files (in JS, TXT, and CSV formats) that contain the data used to make the visualizations here, which is a subset of the data on the GISTEMP site.Visualize the data in any meaningful way you wish

Figure 1 :-  X-axes is year considered in the step of 10years from 1880 to 2020. Y-axes is the change in temparature for the month of June. Data set used is ExcelFormattedGISTEMPDataCSV file provided in the zip folder.I am trying to show the alarming climate change rate i.e the variation in the temerature considering just one month to show how the temerature has drastically increased from the year 1880 to 2015 and the result is just an eye opener.

Figure 2:-  X-axes is year considered in the step of 10years from 1880 to 2020. Y-axes is the change in temparature for the month of June. Data set used is ExcelFormattedGISTEMPData2CSV file provided in the zip folder.I am trying to show the alarming global temerature change(in blue),NHem temeprature change(in red) i.e Northen hemisphere and SHem temparature change(in yellow) i.e Southeren Hemishpehere.How the temerature has drastically increased from the year 1880 to 2015 and the result is just an eye opener.
